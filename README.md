# Automatic-Literature-Review-using-AI

These Python scripts are designed to perform an automatic literature review using the OpenAlex API to gather publications and the Gemini API (from Google AI) to classify them based on relevance to a specific topic.

## Scripts Included

*   **`openalex_call.py`**: This script queries the OpenAlex API to retrieve academic papers based on a predefined search query. It focuses on publications related to electromyostimulation and motor learning. The script extracts various metadata from the retrieved papers, including titles, abstracts, concepts, authors, affiliations, and more, and saves the results to an Excel file.
*   **`gemini_call.py`**: This script takes the Excel file generated by `openalex_call.py` as input. It uses the Gemini API to classify each paper based on whether it fits within a specific scoping review topic: "using Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for proprioceptive or kinesthetic feedback in AR/VR haptic feedback". The classification results (True/False) are then saved to another Excel file.

## Prerequisites

Before running these scripts, you need to:

1.  **Install Python Libraries:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install requests pandas google-generativeai openpyxl
    ```

2.  **Get a Gemini API Key:** You need to obtain an API key from Google AI Studio (or Google Cloud, depending on the Gemini API you intend to use).  Follow the official Google AI documentation to get your API key.

3.  **Set the Gemini API Key as an Environment Variable:** For security, do **not** hardcode your API key in the script. Set it as an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

    *   **On Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
        Add this line to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or similar shell configuration file to make it persistent.

    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
        For persistent environment variables, use the System Environment Variables settings in the Control Panel.

    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        $env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
        For persistent environment variables: `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY', 'User')`

    **Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.**

## Usage

1.  **Run `openalex_call.py`:**
    ```bash
    python openalex_call.py
    ```
    This script will:
    *   Query the OpenAlex API based on the predefined search query.
    *   Ask you to confirm if you want to proceed with retrieving all records after showing the total matches.
    *   Save the retrieved records to an Excel file named `Electromyostimulation_MotorLearning_OpenAlex.xlsx` in the `output_data` subdirectory.
    *   The `output_data` directory will be created in the same directory as the script if it doesn't exist.

2.  **Run `gemini_call.py`:**
    ```bash
    python gemini_call.py
    ```
    This script will:
    *   Read the Excel file generated by `openalex_call.py` from the `output_data` subdirectory.
    *   Classify each paper using the Gemini API to determine if it fits the scoping review topic.
    *   Save the classification results to an Excel file named `Electromyostimulation_MotorLearning_Gemini.xlsx` in the `output_data` subdirectory.

## File Paths

*   **Input File Path (`gemini_call.py`):**  The `gemini_call.py` script is configured to read the input Excel file from the `output_data` subdirectory, expecting the output from `openalex_call.py`.
*   **Output File Paths (`openalex_call.py` and `gemini_call.py`):** Both scripts are set to save their output Excel files in the `output_data` subdirectory.
*   **Customize Paths (If Needed):** If you need to change the input or output directories or filenames, you can modify the `output_dir`, `INPUT_FILE`, and `OUTPUT_FILE` variables at the beginning of each script.

## Important Notes

*   **API Key Security:** Never hardcode API keys in your scripts when sharing them publicly. Using environment variables is a secure way to manage API keys.
*   **Rate Limits:** Both the OpenAlex and Gemini APIs have rate limits. The scripts include `time.sleep()` pauses to be polite and try to avoid hitting these limits. Be mindful of these limits if you modify the scripts to run more frequently or with larger batches.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included, but you might want to enhance it for production use.
*   **Customization:**  Feel free to adapt the search query in `openalex_call.py` and the classification prompt in `gemini_call.py` to suit your specific literature review needs.
